Tyger is creating an open platform to publish and solve the most important challenges in synthetic biology.

The Challenge application is written in Django and controls the creation, display and update of challenges that are submitted and solved by the Tyger community.

The Canvas application is the IDE for bio-developers.

We will use piston to create open APIs that mimic the core challenge functionality, allowing bio-developers to use the design platform of their choosing.

Configuration best practices:
-Update the settings.py file to reflect your local environment.
