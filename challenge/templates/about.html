        <p>Tyger makes it easy to design new life, improve the world, and make money in the process. </p>
        <p> We believe synthetic biology will transform the 21st century and we wanted to start tinkering. But we didn't have easy access to a PCR machine and all the other fancy (read: expensive) lab technology to get our hands dirty. So we started working on a platform to de-couple the design of new life from the "wet work" in the lab. That became the Bench. </p>
        <p>We also wanted to work on big ideas. We want to save a billion lives, send humanity to the stars, and all sorts of other projects that sound like science fiction but are very close to our grasp. But the biggest ideas are spread all across the community and not always obvious. So we created the Challenge system to help the best ideas bubble to the top and connect users to cool projects that can change the world.  </p>

        <h2> Work for Tyger </h2>
        <p>We're looking for incredibly smart people who want to change the world. If you want to work hard on something that's more interesting than a self-tweeting iphone app, get it touch.
